        "description": "The box office is united behind “Civil War.” A24’s dystopian thriller earned $10.7 million from 3,838 locations across its opening day and preview screenings, putting itself on track for a debut north around $26 million.The debut figure represents the highest opening day gross ever for A24, besting the $5.1 million earned by 2018’s “Hereditary” in its first screenings. That horror feature still holds the record for the indie banner’s highest opening weekend ever, with a $13.5 million tally — a watermark that “Civil War” should be able to surge above before the end of Saturday. “Civil War” also gets a boost in sales from playing in premium-large format auditoriums like Imax.It’s a record that the Alex Garland-directed war feature needs to break since it’s also the most expensive feature in the history of A24. “Civil War” cost $50 million to produce, plus additional costs for marketing and distribution.

So far, it’s made $2.9 million at the box office in Thursday previews.“Civil War” has its sights set on the highest opening weekend ever for an A24 movie. The film, which takes place in a fractured America torn apart by civil war, is projected to make around $20 million in its opening weekend. Some estimates are as high as $24 million and as low as $15 million, but even that would break the A24 record.

As conceptually logical and narratively sound as the rise of Darth Vader is on paper, it's perplexing enough in motion to merit me writing an article explaining Anakin's fall to the dark side for all those folks who watched the films and yet still came away scratching their heads.In contrast, you get a far more satisfying depiction of Anakin and his transformation in \"The Clone Wars,\" the animated show following Anakin (Matt Lanter...See full article at Slash Film",

The series will dive deep into the investigation, and how both Gladstone's character and an author (Riley Keough) writing about the case get to the truth of what happened at the murder scene. The series will also show how this story sparked concerns about bullying and violence in the school setting, making way for several preventative measures.

Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick, with their unstoppable, night-visioned antihero? No, of course not! Because Vin Deisel's role — the one that best demonstrates his immutable virility — is none other than Disney's family-friendly offering The Pacifier. As a Navy Seal turned long-term babysitter, Vin Diesel maintains his monotone effect throughout the put-upon chaos he's supposed to be mugging for. It increases the sense of dissonance that haunts the entire film: Even if you can suspend your disbelief in the movie's plot, you don't see a character on screen. You see Vin Diesel. Thankfully, among so many other action-hero-becomes a-family-man-movies, that becomes this movie's strength. (Pun intended).See full article at Collider.com",

This idealist attitude swings both ways, as instead of creating a cinematic masterpiece, you create a hilariously awful movie that is forever canonized. Perhaps it's more advantageous to be comically inept rather than forgettably inept, but with a film like Gotti, being a film of such poor quality is concerning. This film aspires to be a modern gangster film classic. While the genre has produced some of the great films in history--ones that are timeless and revisited by multiple generations of viewers, misguided attempts at reaching the same heights as The Godfather and Goodfellas often result in colossal creative failures.

Long before Villeneuve jumped headfirst into the world of science fiction with Blade Runner 2049 and Dune, Arrival tells a compelling dramatic story about extra-terrestrial visitors that is less about aliens and more about how humans would react to these larger-than-life visitors. More importantly, it's about how one humble linguistics teacher tries to prevent a third World War born completely out of fear and uncertainty. As fans of Villeneuve's work already know, he's a filmmaker who loves to play with audiences' expectations and the concept of time itself.

But one character in the franchise stands above the rest, constantly battling the future while holding tightly to the past. No, we're not talking about Sarah Connor. We're talking about her son, John Connor, who was prophesied to be the leader of the human resistance against Skynet in the eventual Future War. But while we've seen plenty of actors tackle the John Connor character since Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it's his time on television, played by Thomas Dekker, that stands out as the most memorable.See full article at Collider.com",

        "description": "Ahsoka had no shortage of characters from Star Wars: Rebels, with Hera (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Sabine (Natasha Liu Bordizzo), Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen), and Ezra (Eman Esfandi) playing notable roles. Though best known for her role in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the title character (Rosario Dawson) even had an important role in Rebels. The two shows are so interconnected that Ahsoka practically served as a direct sequel despite the different formats. Ahsoka goes as far as recreating the epilogue scene in live-action. However, a few characters from the animated series didn't make the jump. Notably, the Lasat and member of the Ghost crew, Zeb (Steve Blum), was left out, as was the self-sacrificing Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Unlike Zeb, Kanan couldn't physically appear for one good reason: he tragically dies in Rebels.See full article at Collider.com",

Chalamet's starring role in 2017's Call Me by Your Name might've put him on everyone's radar, but before the actor's turn in the Oscar-winning romance, he led the way alongside Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka in the supernaturally-infused indie, One & Two.See full article at Collider.com",

A Most Violent Year, written and directed by J.C. Chandor, utilizes its unsettlingly cold and quiet 1960s New York setting to offer a unique take on the genre. There's no denying Oscar Isaac's vast range and versatility, and his turn as the film's emerging mob leader is a shining example of exactly that. With Isaac at the helm as trucking company boss Abel Morales, A Most Violent Year pits business competitors against one another in a battle for territory and resources in the swiftly expanding New York oil industry.

Although this was Rudd's first released movie, it wasn't the first one he filmed a part for. That distinction goes to Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, the sixth film in the series, and one so disastrous that it would cause the franchise to undergo a complete reboot.

        "description": "The thing with playing a fictional character is that certain things from one's real life are going to impact that character. This came into play for Emily Deschanel during her long run as Temperance Brennan on \"Bones.\" During the show's seventh season, Deschanel was pregnant, which impacted the production. Part of that was solved by her character also being pregnant, even though half of the season's planned episodes still had to be scrapped. But other problems were solved simply by Deschanel being unwilling to surrender parts of her job, including stunts.Executive producers Hart Hanson and Stephen Nathan discussed \"Bones\" season 7 ahead of its premiere back in 2011 with TV Tango. The duo explained that they hired a stunt double for the actor, figuring somewhat reasonably that she would need it given that she was toward the end of her pregnancy. But as Nathan revealed, even though she was literally days away from giving birth,...See full article at Slash Film",

Blackthorne arrives as an emissary of the Dutch and British Empires, to disrupt the relationship between Japan and Portugal. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit Japan, and introduced Catholicism, the dominant religion in Portugal, to the country. Several key plot points in Shōgun turn on the fact that many of the Japanese characters are openly practicing Catholics, including some of the country's most powerful officials.See full article at Collider.com",

When a film is compelling and entertaining enough that it's able to hold the audience's attention for a whopping three hours or longer, it's an admirable feat like no other in the realm of filmmaking. Some of the greatest films ever made are over three hours long, from ambitious historical epics to profound dramas, and plenty of these nailed outstanding numbers at the box office.See full article at Collider.com",

        "link": "https://collider.com/tom-cruise-born-on-the-fourth-of-july/",
        "description": "Generally speaking, in movie language, there is a clear divide between movie stars and actors. For the crowd that valorizes the dramatic chops and artistry of the actor, this is a badge of honor. Movie stars have the glamor and privilege, but they are usually regarded as lesser performers. In essence, movie stars provide popcorn entertainment, while actors expand one's cultural taste. Movie stars, as successful entrepreneurs in their own right, want to keep succeeding. This drive eventually calls for them to take on parts that showcase their dramatic chops, which will inevitably inspire doubters. In 1989, when Tom Cruise, the preeminent movie star of the time, decided to play a real-life Vietnam War veteran inflicted by combat wounds in Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July, the skepticism of audiences, and even his director, was forever silenced. Cruise earned his first of three Academy Award nominations for his...See full article at Collider.com",

Hawks almost single-handedly created the template for the modern romantic comedy with his classic films His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby, and earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director for his work on the classic biopic Sergeant York. While he was a versatile storyteller who often played within many genres, Hawks was able to create a unique style of Westerns that emphasized character development and thematic depth over traditionally satisfying narratives. When pitching his latest Western to his skeptical star, Hawks described his new film El Dorado as “no story, just characters.”...See full article at Collider.com",

Five characters managed to become part of the group by the start of Glee Season 4, but only one left a mark on the show despite her short-lived presence. Marley Rose, played by Melissa Benoist, had one of the most angelic vocals of the bunch, and, unlike other characters in the show, she wasn't interested in competing for attention. Her talent and passion for singing always transpired in her music numbers, and her kindness was admirable amid all the high school drama. Despite Marley not...See full article at Collider.com",

You need one for a gun — at least in sophisticated countries.

While Golden Age of Hollywood directors like John Ford and John Huston certainly became recognizable to an audience beyond cinephiles, Hitchcock’s name was itself a tool in a film’s marketing and distribution. The term “Hitchcockian” has emerged as a means of describing intense thrillers that prioritize anxiety, suspense, and dark humor. While he had the ability to conjure an audience based solely on his involvement, Hitchcock was also highly selective in how audiences received and viewed his films. Perhaps to preserve the legacy of some of his finest films, Hitchcock forbade audiences from seeing five of his most famous films for over two decades.See full article at Collider.com",

Its brick walls, wood paneling, and old-school jukebox evoke both its Boston setting and something broader, the kind of place one might expect to find nestled down a random street in any major American city, but it was actually based on a very real bar that the series creators visited while first developing the show! While that sounds like it could really be a great thing for a bar, given how immensely popular \"Cheers\" was in the 1980s, it actually ended up causing some rather interesting problems, especially for the bar's regulars.In the book \"Cheers: A Cultural History\" By Joseph J.

This is a Bond who's more or less given up the spy game to be with the love of his life, Madeline Swann (Léa Seydoux). Part of what makes No Time to Die unique is the creatives behind the camera; director Cary Joji Fukunaga and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued the trend of humanizing Craig's bond, taking it to the extreme by showing that he was actually mortal. Prior to its release, No Time to Die weathered a rocky production process that saw a director exit, release dates get delayed, and even a struggle for the movie rights.See full article at Collider.com",
