        "description": "When I first learned that Bad Bunny's sold-out Most Wanted Tour included three back-to-back shows at the Barclays Center in NYC and one that landed on my birthday, April 11, it all seemed meant to be. The concert would occur three days after a highly anticipated solar eclipse, a new moon, and all during a Mercury retrograde. It would also happen during Aries season - the beginning of the astrological year and a time for new beginnings. While I had high expectations for Benito's performance and his first NYC show from the tour, one thing that stood out most is how the Puerto Rican artist continues to appreciate and celebrate his loyal Latine fans.Bad Bunny is the most-streamed artist on the planet. This fun fact never loses its significance for loyal Latine fans who have witnessed the struggle for Latin music to get the respect and support it deserves here in the States.See full article at Popsugar.com",

On April 6, the three-time Grammy winner performed her second of four sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City. And for an hour and a half on Saturday night, Rodrigo reminded us of the good, bad, and ugly of girlhood.A bag adorned with ribbon bows slung over my shoulder, I screamed in anticipation with a crowd full of sequin miniskirts, glittery purple eyeshadow, and fishnet tights as Rodrigo ascended onto the stage for her opening number, \"Bad Idea Right.\" To my surprise, the audience wasn't just young teens, kids, and their parents. An unexpected handful of 20- and 30-something adults like me were just as ready to jump and sing along to a mix of tunes from her sophomore album, \"Guts,\" and her critically acclaimed debut album,...See full article at Popsugar.com",

        "description": "Jennifer Lopez has been busy. In case you missed it, the Puerto Rican singer, dancer, and actor released not one but three complementary projects to kick off the year. There's her \"This Is Me . . . Now\" album; a video companion/musical to said album, \"This Is Me . . . Now: A Love Story\"; and a documentary that dives into said love story, \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told.\" It was an ambitious undertaking, no doubt. And one that has her being dragged across TikTok, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter).Part of the controversy lies in how Lopez represents herself and her native borough of the Bronx. In one scene from the documentary, Lopez tussles her curly hair while looking in the mirror and says, \"It reminds me, like, when I was 16 in the Bronx, running up and down the block.

But despite my fascination with storytelling, pursuing a career in writing never seemed realistic. Instead, I majored in English and embarked on a somewhat related career in cause-based communications and marketing.At those jobs, I met a lot of women who were creating art that was meaningful to them and their communities. They weren't household names, but they showed me that I'd been wrong. They proved to me that writers who look like me or grew up with similar experiences deserve a shot at getting our stories out there.At the same time, I decided to finally go for it and pursue a career as a professional writer. I couldn't help but note the number of organizations that were embracing Latina storytelling.See full article at Popsugar.com",

        "description": "According to new McKinsey & Company research, there are over 62 million Latinos living in the United States who not only account for more than $3 trillion of Gdp but are also avid consumers of film and TV. US Latinos account for 24 percent of box office ticket sales and 24 percent of streaming subscribers. Yet somehow, there still aren't enough Latines behind and in front of the camera even though our viewership doubles when we see ourselves represented on or off screen.Today, we still don't have enough TV programming that accurately represents us - and the few shows that have been created for us and by us, like \"Vida,\" \"One Day at a Time,\" \"Promised Land,\" and \"Gentefied,\" were eventually all canceled despite their popularity. Among these many cancellations was Dominican American creator Claudia Forestieri's beloved \"Gordita Chronicles,\" which was released in June 2022 on HBO Max and was canceled after just one season.See full article at Popsugar.com",

        "description": "There's no arguing that Shakira is a feminist icon. Entering the year on the heels of a very public split from her long-term partner and the father of her two sons, Gerard Piqué, she managed to take a painful experience and turn it into a shared triumph. Her latest studio album, \"Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\" is a testament to independence and the strength that comes with it. It's a sentiment that many, especially women, will be able to relate to. In her recent Allure cover interview published on April 1, Shakira delves into what that strength looks like and what it means to be a woman healing today. But one thing that stood out from the interview was the singer's controversial take on another feminist pop culture pillar: the \"Barbie\" movie.Shakira shares her sons \"absolutely hated\" the film because they \"felt it was emasculating.\" \"I like pop culture when...See full article at Popsugar.com",

When the Colombian pop star learned in 2022 that Gerard Piqué, her partner of 11 years and the father of her two sons, was cheating on her, I'm sure it felt as if her life was falling apart. But when she couldn't bear the pain and the betrayal, she did what most musicians do - she turned it into art.The first song Shakira released that was directly related to the breakup was 2022's \"Te Felicito\" with Puerto Rican Latin trap artist Rauw Alejandro. The song not only marked Shakira's comeback, it was also the first in a string of singles that would display her healing journey to the world and eventually become part of her latest highly anticipated album, \"Las Mujeres Ya no Lloran,\" which was released on March 22.Related: America Ferrera Didn’t Win an Oscar,...See full article at Popsugar.com",

But the Feb. 4 ceremony celebrated not only women nominees, but also winners, performers, and presenters - at every age. From longtime legends to rising artists, women celebrated each other unabashedly in an industry that tends to emphasize youth and often pits women against each other. For the first time in years, an award show seemed to hit the mark on entertaining audiences across generations, striking the perfect chord between embracing nostalgia and highlighting newer talent.Women nominees were up for every major category, and ultimately snagged the big wins, too.

Like Bruce, the 27-year-old actor and content creator was raised by a single mom in the San Gabriel Valley, CA, a predominantly Asian American community where the series partially takes place. Similarly, he also dreamed of being an actor and improv comedian, despite his mom's hopes that he'd become a doctor. \"I feel like that especially is just really relatable for a lot of Asian Americans,...See full article at Popsugar.com",

        "description": "The Netflix movie \"May December\" is heavily inspired by the real-life relationship between Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau, which is probably why its depiction of stereotypes of Asian men feels so close to reality, too. The morally problematic tale takes viewers on a complex journey with troubling racial implications, particularly as they relate to weaponized whiteness and the depiction of Asian masculinity as subservient and childlike.This highly publicized case, as well as its fictionalized version depicted in \"May December,\" raises a central question: how did the fact that she's a white woman impact not only her ability to groom him - an Asian American boy - but also the public's reaction to the story?This feeds into the harmful stereotype that Asian men are complacent and obedient.In \"May December,\" Julianne Moore plays Gracie, the fictionalized version of Letourneau, who began sexually abusing Fualauu when he was her sixth-grade student.See full article at Popsugar.com",

        "description": "Many popular musicians have created fictional alter egos as a way to explore new sonic avenues that they wish to experiment with. David Bowie had Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, David Johansen had Buster Poindexter, Lady Gaga spent a whole season as Jo Calderone, and the less said about Garth Brooks's Chris Gaines era the better, but it certainly happened. For them, it's a kind of performance art - an expression of their interest in stepping out of their comfort zone and giving the endeavor a theatrical flair as well.The debate about whether these could be considered merely publicity stunts is valid, but for some artists, there's a true creative desire to inhabit these personas. For Adriana Rivera, a Puerto Rican singer-songwriter, it's a culmination of her dream to merge two artistic outputs that have long fascinated and inspired her: music and acting.

They'd play at every family function, during long car rides, or at the beach, and he was likely your mami's favorite artist to blast during her Saturday morning cleaning rituals. Throughout his prolific and four-decade career, Guerra has not only reinvented the tropical rhythms of his native Dominican Republic alongside his band 4.40, but he's also reached audiences way beyond just the Dominican community. With 30 million-plus albums sold around the world and more than 20 Latin Grammy wins, Guerra has become a legend in the Latin music space and not just for his poetic lyrics - he's often referred to as the Pablo Neruda of merengue and bachata - but also for never being afraid to innovate or color outside of the lines of what \"Dominican music\" is supposed to sound like.See full article at Popsugar.com",

        "description": "It's that time of year again! On Nov. 8, People crowned this year's Sexiest Man Alive, Patrick Dempsey. If you're wondering how the publication makes its choice, according to People's former Editor in Chief Dan Wakeford, the magazine makes its selection not only based on a celebrity's looks but also their overall demeanor.\"Being sexy is about being decent, intelligent, funny, and talented,\" Wakeford previously told CNN. He added that someone \"who creates buzz\" is a requirement and that sometimes who they're in a relationship with may give them bonus points.As Dempsey joins this exclusive club, take a trip down memory lane by seeing all the past winners, including Chris Evans, Michael B. Jordan, Idris Elba, David Beckham, Chris Hemsworth, Channing Tatum, Bradley Cooper, and more.See full article at Popsugar.com",

        "description": "\"Gossip Girl\" tells the story of a bunch of wealthy Upper East Siders (and a few Brooklynites) as they deal with drama, romance, and chaos in the Big Apple. The show, which ran from 2007 to 2012, also happened to make much of its young cast into huge stars. Blake Lively, of course, starred as Serena van der Woodsen on \"Gossip Girl\" and has since gone on to be a prominent A-lister. Penn Badgley, who played the seemingly innocuous Dan Humphrey, now stars as another seemingly harmless (but very murderous) character on the hit show \"You.\" Meanwhile, Taylor Momsen, who played Dan's little sister Jenny Humphrey, transitioned from television into a successful music career after leaving \"Gossip Girl\"; she currently fronts the band The Pretty Reckless.Not that much time has passed since \"Gossip Girl,\" though the show already received a reboot that ran from 2021 to 2023.

Still, the movie left fans with one major question: will there be an \"Enola Holmes 3\"? It seems like the odds are pretty good, because on Nov. 7, Collider reported that a screenplay for a third installment was in the works.The news came via an interview with the head of Netflix Film, Scott Stuber, who also praised Brown's performance. \"You know, she's such a great homegrown star for us,\" he told Collider of Brown. \"I mean, obviously, 'Stranger Things' is huge for us in that, and watching her grow as an actress . . .\" He also hinted at a possible third Enola Holmes movie. \"The Holmes IP is weirdly elastic.

        "description": "Showtime's \"The Curse\" stars Emma Stone and Nathan Fielder as two newlyweds who attempt to launch a house-flipping HGTV series in the town of Española, Nm. However, their show, and their efforts to start a family, become complicated by the presence of what might just be a curse.The premise might sound a bit absurd, but it also may ring a few bells if you've ever seen any of television's many, many house-flipping and home renovation shows. From HGTV's \"Flip or Flop\" and \"Property Brothers\" to Netflix's \"Tiny House Nation\" and \"Dream Home Makeover,\" it's clear the public has a never-ending appetite for renovation and real-estate-related television. Meanwhile, Stone and Fielder's characters themselves might bring to mind another famous couple in the televised home improvement business - Chip and Joanna Gaines, who cohosted the HGTV show \"Fixer Upper\" from 2013 to 2018. From there, they launched their own media company called...See full article at Popsugar.com",
